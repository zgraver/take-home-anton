    1. In terms of architecture decisions, I chose to make this challenge using React.js and moment.js. 
    The reason for this is that React is a widely used and powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, 
    it makes it easy to break down the requirements into small reusable components and handle the dynamic updates.
    And moment.js is an excellent library for handling date and time operations, which is needed to filter the timelogs by month and year.

    2. In terms of difficulty, the challenge was relatively straightforward. 
    I had to use the given API, filter the timelogs by month and year, and display the filtered data in a user-friendly manner.

    3. I did not encounter any major problems while working on this challenge. 
    The only minor issue was figuring out how to filter the timelogs based on the month and year selected by the user.
    To solve this, I used the moment.js library which made it very easy to work with date and time operations.

    4. In terms of improvements, one thing I could do is to use pagination to load the data in chunks,
    so that it would not cause any lag on the page loading time when the number of timelogs increases.
    Additionally, I could make more dynamic the layout to allow customization and more readable,
    also It could be added more features like for example a search bar on the header to look for specific timelogs or a sort function.
